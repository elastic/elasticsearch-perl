# ABSTRACT: Provides common functionality for Client implementations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role provides a common C<perform_request()> method for Client
implementations.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<perform_request()>

This method takes whatever arguments it is passed and passes them directly to
a C<parse_request()> method (which should be provided by Client implementations).
The C<parse_request()> method should return a request suitable for passing
to L<Elasticsearch::Transport/perform_request()>.
