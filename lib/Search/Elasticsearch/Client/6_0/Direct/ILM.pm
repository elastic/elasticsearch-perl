# ABSTRACT: Plugin providing index lifecycle management APIs for Search::Elasticsearch 6.x

=head2 DESCRIPTION

This module provides methods to use the index lifecycle management feature.

The full documentation for ILM is available here:
L<https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-lifecycle-management.html>

=head1 POLICY METHODS

=head2 C<put_lifecycle()>

    $response = $es->ilm->put_lifecycle(
        policy  => $policy  # required
        body    => {...}    # required
    )

The C<put_lifecycle()> method creates or updates a lifecycle policy.

Query string parameters:
    C<error_trace>,
    C<filter_path>,
    C<human>

See the L<ILM put_lifecycle docs|https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ilm-put-lifecycle.html>
for more information.

=head2 C<put_lifecycle()>

    $response = $es->ilm->put_lifecycle(
        policy  => $policy  # required
        body    => {...}    # required
    )

The C<put_lifecycle()> method creates or updates a lifecycle policy.

Query string parameters:
    C<error_trace>,
    C<filter_path>,
    C<human>

See the L<ILM put_lifecycle docs|https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ilm-put-lifecycle.html>
for more information.


=head2 C<get_lifecycle()>

    $response = $es->ilm->get_lifecycle(
        policy  => $policy  # required
    )

The C<get_lifecycle()> method retrieves the specified policy

Query string parameters:
    C<error_trace>,
    C<filter_path>,
    C<human>

See the L<ILM get_lifecycle docs|https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ilm-get-lifecycle.html>
for more information.

=head2 C<delete_lifecycle()>

    $response = $es->ilm->delete_lifecycle(
        policy  => $policy  # required
    )

The C<delete_lifecycle()> method deletes the specified policy

Query string parameters:
    C<error_trace>,
    C<filter_path>,
    C<human>

See the L<ILM delete_lifecycle docs|https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ilm-remove-lifecycle.html>
for more information.

=head1 INDEX MANAGEMENT METHODS

=head2 C<move_to_step()>

    $response = $es->ilm->move_to_step(
        index  => $index,       # required
        body   => {...}         # required
    )

The C<move_to_step()> method triggers execution of a specific step in the lifecycle policy.

Query string parameters:
    C<error_trace>,
    C<filter_path>,
    C<human>

See the L<ILM move_to_step docs|https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ilm-move-to-step.html>
for more information.


=head2 C<retry()>

    $response = $es->ilm->retry(
        index  => $index,       # required
    )

The C<retry()> method retries executing the policy for an index that is in the ERROR step.

Query string parameters:
    C<error_trace>,
    C<filter_path>,
    C<human>

See the L<ILM retry docs|https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ilm-retry.html>
for more information.


=head2 C<remove_lifecycle()>

    $response = $es->ilm->remove_lifecycle(
        index  => $index  # required
    )

The C<remove_lifecycle()> method removes a lifecycle from the specified index.

Query string parameters:
    C<error_trace>,

    )

The C<explain_lifecycle()> method returns information about the indexâ€™s current lifecycle state.

Query string parameters:
    C<error_trace>,
    C<filter_path>,
    C<human>

See the L<ILM explain_lifecycle docs|https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ilm-explain-lifecycle.html>
for more information.


=head1 OPERATION MANAGEMENT APIS

=head2 C<status()>
