# ABSTRACT: Thin client with full support for Elasticsearch 6.x APIs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The L<Search::Elasticsearch::Client::6_0> package provides a client
compatible with Elasticsearch 6.x.  It should be used in conjunction
with L<Search::Elasticsearch> as follows:

    $e = Search::Elasticsearch->new(
        client => "6_0::Direct"
    );

See L<Search::Elasticsearch::Client::6_0::Direct> for documentation
about how to use the client itself.

This version of the client supports the Elasticsearch 6.0 branch,
which is not backwards compatible with earlier branches.
