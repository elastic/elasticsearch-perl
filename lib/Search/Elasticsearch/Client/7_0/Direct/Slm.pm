# ABSTRACT: Plugin providing Snapshot Lifecycle Management (SLM) for Search::Elasticsearch 7.x

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $response = $es->slm->status()

=head2 DESCRIPTION

This class extends the L<Search::Elasticsearch> client with an C<slm>
namespace, to support the
L<SLM APIs|https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/snapshot-lifecycle-management-api.html>.

=head1 GENERAL METHODS

=head2 C<get_stats()>

    $response = $es->slm->get_stats()

The C<get_stats()> method returns global and policy-level statistics about actions
taken by snapshot lifecycle management.

=head2 C<get_lifecycle()>

    $response = $es->slm->get_lifecycle()

The C<get_lifecycle()> method retrieves one or more snapshot lifecycle policy definitions and
information about the latest snapshot attempts.

=head2 C<put_lifecycle()>

    $response = $es->slm->put_lifecycle()

The C<put_lifecycle()> method creates or updates a snapshot lifecycle policy.

=head2 C<delete_lifecycle()>

    $response = $es->slm->delete_lifecycle()

The C<delete_lifecycle()> method deletes an existing snapshot lifecycle policy.

=head2 C<execute_lifecycle()>

    $response = $es->slm->execute_lifecycle()

The C<execute_lifecycle()> method immediately creates a snapshot according to the lifecycle
policy, without waiting for the scheduled time.

=head2 C<(execute_retention())>

    $response = $es->slm->execute_retention()

The C<execute_retention()> method deletes any snapshots that are expired according
to the policyâ€™s retention rules.
