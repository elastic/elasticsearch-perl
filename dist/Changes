5.01    2016-10-19

        Doc fixes

5.00    2016-10-19

        This version adds Elasticsearch 5.x compatibility, and makes it the default.
        It also adds deprecation logging which logs to STDERR by default.

        The Hijk backend will not work with Elasticsearch 5.x until this bug
        is fixed: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=118425

        BREAKING CHANGES:
        * The 0.90, 1.x, and 2.x compatible clients no longer ship by default.
          You should install one of the following:
              * Search::Elasticsearch::Client::2_0
              * Search::Elasticsearch::Client::2_0::Async
              * Search::Elasticsearch::Client::1_0
              * Search::Elasticsearch::Client::1_0::Async
              * Search::Elasticsearch::Client::0_90
              * Search::Elasticsearch::Client::0_90::Async
        * The code has been reorganised so that all client-related modules
          are under the S::E::API_VERSION::Client namespace.
          This includes S::E::Bulk and S::E::Scroll.
        * Plugin authors note: the format for the API in ...Role::API has changed.
        * S::E::Cxn::HTTP has been rolled into S::E::Cxn as Elasticsearch
          no longer supports other protocols.

2.03    2016-05-24

        Added register_qs() to allow plugins to expand known query string params
        Added api_version() to API roles so that plugins can determine which
        API version they should load.

2.02    2016-04-20

        Bug fix:
            Sniffed http addresses may or may not have the hostname/ prepended

2.00    2015-10-28

        The default client is now '2_0::Direct', for use with Elasticsearch 2.x.
        Specify client '1_0::Direct' if using with Elasticsearch 1.x.

        Breaking:

1.14    2014-07-24
        Added support for indexed scripts and indexed templates.

1.13    2014-06-13
        Breaking change:
            The Scroll helper used to pass the scroll ID to
            scroll() and clear_scroll() in the query string by default,
            with the scroll_in_body parameter to change the behaviour.
            This was causing frequent errors with long scroll IDs, so
            the new default behaviour is to pass the scroll ID in the
            body, with the scroll_in_qs parameter to change that
            behaviour.
        All Search::Elasticsearch HTTP backends are now fork safe.
        Added track_scores param to search()
        Added create param to indices.put_template()

        Added search_shards()
        Added char_filters to indices.analyze()
        Removed index_templates from cluster.state()
        Added conf to TestServer for passing arbitrary config

1.11    2014-04-23
        Switched default Serializer::JSON to use JSON::MaybeXS, and added
        Serializer backends for Cpanel::JSON::XS, JSON::XS and JSON::PP

        Added scroll_in_body flag for Scroll helper

        Added support for:
          * search_template()
          * snapshot->status()
          * indices->recovery()
          * benchmark()
          * list_benchmarks()

        Improved documentation.
        Added Hijk backend.

1.04    2014-02-27

        Changed the default Cxn to HTTPTiny v0.043. Now provides persistent
        connections and is a lot faster than LWP.

        Changed ES::Scroll to pass the scroll_id in the URL instead of the
        body. Better support for older versions and servers behind caching
        proxies.

1.03    2014-02-12
        Fixed node sniffing to work across 0.90 and 1.0

        which complains about undefined versions

        API updated to be compatible with v1.x branch of Elasticsearch.

        BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY: To use this client with versions of
        Elasticsearch before 1.x, specify the client version as:

            $es = Elasticsearch->new(
                client => '0_90::Direct'
            );

        Added Elasticsearch::TestServer
        Die with explanation if a user on a case-insensitive file system
        loads this module instead of ElasticSearch

0.72    2013-09-29
        Added Elasticsearch::Bulk and Elasticsearch::Scroll
        Changed `https` to `use_https` for compatibility with elasticsearch-py
        Numerous fixes for different Perl versions, and Moo 1.003 now required

0.71    2013-09-24
        Fixed dist.ini to list dependencies correctly

0.70    2013-09-24
        Bumped version numbers because CPAN clashes
        with ElasticSearch.pm
